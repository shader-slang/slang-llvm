Slang LLVM/Clang Library
========================

NOTE! The [Slang LLVM/Clang library](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang-llvm) project is currently *not functional*! 

The purpose of this project is to use the LLVM/Clang infrastructure to provide features for the [Slang language compiler](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang/). 

These features may include

* Use as a replacement for a file based downstream C++ compiler for CPU targets
* Allow the 'host-callable' to generate in memory executable code directly
* Allow parsing of C/C++ code 
* Compile Slang code to bitcode 
* JIT execution of bitcode
